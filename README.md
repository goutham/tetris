![Tetris](/img/screenshot.png)

A tetris clone for MS-DOS which I wrote circa 2005.

Code should be compilable using Borland Turbo C compiler (warning: I have not attempted this recently) but an old executable I had handy is included under `bin/`. The game runs fine with [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com). It is also playable online using [archive.org](http://archive.org)'s EM-DOSBOX in-browser emulator at https://archive.org/details/super-tetrix-1 (but this one has some minor display quirks).
